# Project-Solar-Motion-Light
A fully self-sustaining, solar-powered motion sensor light system built around an ESP32. It features deep sleep modes, RTC-based nighttime detection, and a PIR sensor to only activate when neededâ€”ideal for off-grid or remote applications. Future upgrades include a custom PCB and LDR integration for enhanced efficiency and scalability.
